# Rabbit Hole, a RabbitMQ HTTP API Client for Go

This library is a [RabbitMQ HTTP API](http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-management/raw-file/450b7ea22cfd/priv/www/api/index.html) client for the Go language.

## Supported Go Versions

Rabbit Hole requires Go 1.1+.


## Supported RabbitMQ Versions

 * RabbitMQ 3.x
 * RabbitMQ 2.x

All versions require [RabbitMQ Management UI plugin](http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) to be installed and enabled.


## Project Maturity

Rabbit Hole is a **very immature** project and breaking changes are quite likely.
It also completely lacks documentation and at the moment likely isn't useful to
anyone but the author.
